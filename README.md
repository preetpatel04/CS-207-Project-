# CS-207-Project-
Group project ( Preet, Nisarg, Manan)

# Introduction,

The project undertaken for this term was an automatic water dispensing machine. This
was done so that people can easily get water and need not to turn on the taps. In this way it is
very hygienic as the taps have germs on it. If this type of machine is applied in public places
such as hospitals, schools it could prevent many diseases. This is comparatively very cheap as
this type of machine can be setup in less than $ 30. The structure of the dispensing machine is the
simple carboard structure where you put a glass and the water comes out from it. A simple
modification which is done by me in this, as when the temperature is hot along with the water it
also dispenses ice cubes into the glass.
The basic concept of this is as the ultrasonic sensor detects the glass which is placed less
than 3 cm away from the sensor, it activates the relay which turn on the micro air pump, the
micro air pump creates the pressure inside the tube so the water comes out from another tube and
water falls in the glass. If the temperature is more than 26â—¦ C, which is detected by the
temperature sensor, the servo motor activates, which releases the flap and ice cubes drop in.
