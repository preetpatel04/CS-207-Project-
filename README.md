# CS-207-Project-
Group project ( Preet, Nisarg, Manan)

# Introduction,

The project which we are going to do in this term is an automatic sensor
soap dispenser. This was done so that people can easily get soap and need not to
touch the dispenser. In this way it is very hygienic as the dispenser have germs on
it and also as there this virus going around in the world which spreads due to
contact it would be very nice that we would not have to touch the dispenser. If this
type of machine is applied in public places such as hospitals, schools it could
prevent these diseases to spread from one person to another. This is comparatively
very cheap as this type of machine can be setup in less than $45. The structure of
the dispensing machine is the simple structure where we will keep our hand and
the soap comes out from it. A simple modification is done by us that when the
person washes his/her hands there is a hand dryer which passes hot air which will
eventually dry their hands.

## Designing Process,

The designing process of this structure of the dispensing machine is much
complex. Many square and rectangle shapes of the carboard pieces must be cut
down and must be assembled to be to form a structure of the dispensing machine.
In the middle of the cardboard there are 2 holes in which the two eyes of the
ultrasonic sensor will be seen. Behind the in the structure there is an area for the
tank. The tank will be in the form of a plastic bottle.
The main circuit is placed above the container which consists of Arduino
Uno, a servo motor, a DC motor and an ultrasonic sensor. The ultrasonic sensor
has 4 pins namely Vcc, ground, echo and trigo. The echo and trigo are connected
to Arduino to pins 9 and 10 respectively. The Vcc and the ground pin is connected
to the 5 volts and ground. The DC motor input is connected to Arduino via pin 7,
and the servo DATA input is connected to pin 8. Here the power and ground of the
servo motor is connected to 5V and ground. Here as the string attached to servo is
pulled due to the oscillatory motion then the soap comes out. The dryer fan is made
with the DC motor connected to the circuit. As here a delay is set to make the
make the fan run after 25 seconds from the soap dispensing as it is advised to was
hand for at least 20 seconds.
